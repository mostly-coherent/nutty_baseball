## Problem Statement

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Ambient Listening for Game Tracking (Next - Priority)
**Goal:** Track backyard game scores from natural conversation

**The Challenge:** Filtering signal from noise when "that's a strike!" gets mixed with regular chatter. Unlike formal voice commands, backyard games have overlapping voices, excitement, disputes, and casual commentary.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research speech-to-text APIs with real-time streaming (Whisper, Deepgram, AssemblyAI)
- [ ] Build intent classifier: game events vs. casual conversation
- [ ] Handle ambiguity: "was that a strike?" vs. "that's a strike!"
- [ ] Multi-speaker detection (parent vs. kid voices)
- [ ] Confidence threshold for auto-logging vs. confirmation prompts
- [ ] "Undo last score" voice command for disputes
- [ ] Background listening mode with battery optimization
- [ ] Test in real backyard conditions (wind, distance, excitement levels)

**Success Criteria:**
- 80%+ accuracy distinguishing game events from chatter
- Works in noisy outdoor conditions
- No manual button presses during gameplay
- Natural dispute resolution ("wait, that wasn't a strike")

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Game setup wizard (innings, rules, players)
- [ ] Inning-by-inning score entry
- [ ] Current score display with animations
- [ ] Game history archive
- [ ] Support simplified backyard rules
- [ ] Support official Little League rules

**Success Criteria:**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Context-aware commentary system
- [ ] Sandlot wisdom quotes and references

**Success Criteria:**

**Success Criteria:**

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we include pitch counting for Little League safety rules?
- [ ] How detailed should position-specific learning be (e.g., catcher signals)?
- [ ] Should we include any video content or stick to text/images?
- [ ] Do we need a "coach mode" for parents who become team coaches?
- [ ] Should game history be exportable/shareable?
