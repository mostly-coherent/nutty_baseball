> *"Good grief! I need to learn baseball!"* - Every parent whose kid just joined Little League

**Nutty Baseball** is your fun, interactive companion for learning America's pastime alongside your kids. Inspired by Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and the Peanuts gang, this app turns baseball confusion into confidence with playful lessons, game tracking, and just the right amount of gentle teasing when you're losing to your 10-year-old in the backyard.

## 🎯 Why This App Exists

Your kid just signed up for Little League. They know more about baseball from reading Peanuts comics than you do from... well, ever. You want to be supportive, understand what's happening at games, and maybe even play catch without looking completely lost.

**This app is your baseball buddy** - teaching you the rules, helping you track backyard games, and making sure you can confidently cheer from the stands (or at least know what "infield fly rule" means).

## ✨ Features

## 💭 The Story Behind This

My 10-year-old son got really into baseball through Peanuts comics and signed up for Little League. Problem: I knew nothing about baseball. This app is my journey from "What's a strike?" to actually understanding (and enjoying!) the game. If you're in the same boat, welcome aboard! 🚤⚾
